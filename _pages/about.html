I am a PhD student studying Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota.</p> <p>I am interested in applied microeconomics, with a focus on labor and public economics. Broadly, I research topics related to immigration, labor force mobility, and social safety net programs. Currently, I am working on research about the labor market impacts of immigration enforcement.</p> <p>Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant for the <a href="https://www.mda.state.mn.us/marketing/local-regional-partnership" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Minnesota Department of Agriculture Statewide Cooperative Partnership</a>. In this role, I worked with 40+ non-profit organizations to collect and analyze baseline data on producers, supply chain partners, and consumers in Minnesota. These data helped supplement the USDAâ€™s National Agricultural Statistics Service Agricultural Census with data on farmers and markets not fully represented in the Ag Census, including emerging farmers.</p> <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, cross-country skiing, and biking around the Twin Cities.</p> <noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-MMRCVMXF" height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript> </body></html>
