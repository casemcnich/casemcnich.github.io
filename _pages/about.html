Broadly, I research topics related to migration, labor force mobility, and social safety net programs. Currently, I am researching the administrative burdens of the Supplimental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on farmworkers, who have seasonal employment patterns.</p> <p>Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant for the <a href="https://www.mda.state.mn.us/marketing/local-regional-partnership" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Minnesota Department of Agriculture Statewide Cooperative Partnership</a>. In this role I worked with 40+ non-profit organizations to collect and analyze baseline data on producers, supply chain partners, and consumers in Minnesota. These data helped suppliment the USDAâ€™s National Agricultural Statistic Services Agricultural Census with data on farmers and markets not fully represented in the Ag Census, including emerging farmers.</p> <p>In my free time I like to read, xc ski, and bike around the twin cities.</p> </body></html>
