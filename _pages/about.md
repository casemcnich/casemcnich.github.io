Hi! I'm a third-year PhD student studying applied economics at the Universtity of Minnesota.

I'm interested in applied microeconomist, with a focus on labor and public economics. I am currently working on research on social safety net programs, including the Supplimental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). 

In my free time I like to read, xc ski, and bike around the twin cities.
