Hi I am a PhD student studying Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. 

I am interested in applied microeconomics, with a focus on labor and public economics. Broadly, I research topics related to migration, labor force mobility, and social safety net programs. Currently, I am researching the administrative burdens of the Supplimental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on farmworkers, who have seasonal employment patterns. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant for the <a href='https://www.mda.state.mn.us/marketing/local-regional-partnership'>Minnesota Department of Agriculture Statewide Cooperative Partnership</a>. In this role I worked with 40+ non-profit organizations to collect and analyze baseline data on producers, supply chain partners, and consumers in Minnesota. These data helped suppliment the USDAâ€™s National Agricultural Statistic Services Agricultural Census with data on farmers and markets not fully represented in the Ag Census, including emerging farmers. 

In my free time I like to read, xc ski, and bike around the twin cities.
