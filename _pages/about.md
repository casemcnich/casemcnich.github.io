Hi! I am a PhD student studying Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota.

I am interested in applied microeconomics, with a focus on labor and public economics. Broadly, I research topics related to migration, labor force mobility, and social safety net programs. Currently, I am researching the administrative burdens of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on farmworkers, who have seasonal employment patterns.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant for the [Minnesota Department of Agriculture Statewide Cooperative Partnership](https://www.mda.state.mn.us/marketing/local-regional-partnership). In this role, I worked with 40+ non-profit organizations to collect and analyze baseline data on producers, supply chain partners, and consumers in Minnesota. These data helped supplement the USDAâ€™s National Agricultural Statistics Service Agricultural Census with data on farmers and markets not fully represented in the Ag Census, including emerging farmers.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, cross-country skiing, and biking around the Twin Cities.
