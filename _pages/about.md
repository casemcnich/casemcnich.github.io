Hi! I'm a PhD student studying applied economics at the Universtity of Minnesota. I'm interested in applied microeconomics, with a focus on labor and public economics. I am currently working on research on social safety net programs, including the Supplimental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
